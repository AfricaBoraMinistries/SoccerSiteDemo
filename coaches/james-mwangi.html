            <h2>Coaching Philosophy</h2>
            <blockquote>
                "At this age, the most important thing is to help kids fall in love with soccer. If they're 
                having fun and learning the basics properly, everything else will follow. I want every player 
                to leave training with a smile on their face and excitement for the next session."
            </blockquote>
            <p>
                James emphasizes positive reinforcement and individual progress over winning at all costs. 
                He believes that by building confidence and fundamental skills in a supportive environment, 
                young players develop the foundation they need for future success.
