            <blockquote>
                "This age group is where players really start to understand the tactical side of the game. 
                My goal is to develop smart, versatile players who can think critically and adapt to different 
                game situations. But just as important is helping them develop confidence and leadership skills 
                that will serve them throughout their lives."
            </blockquote>
            <p>
                Sarah believes in challenging her players while providing the support they need to succeed. 
                She emphasizes the importance of mental toughness, teamwork, and continuous improvement. Her 
                training sessions are demanding but always purposeful, with clear objectives that help players 
                understand their development.
