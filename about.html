            <h2>Our Story</h2>
            <p>
                Founded in 2020, Africa Bora Soccer Academy was born out of a passion to provide quality soccer 
                training and mentorship to youth in our community. We recognized that many talented young players 
                lacked access to proper coaching, facilities, and opportunities to develop their skills.
            </p>
            <p>
                Since our inception, we have grown from a small group of 15 players to a thriving academy with 
                over 100 youth participants across multiple age groups. Our success is measured not just in wins 
                on the field, but in the character development and life skills our players gain.

                We provide tutoring and homework support for our players, understanding that academic success

                to families in need.
