                <li>Every player deserves individual attention and encouragement</li>
                <li>Technical skills must be developed alongside character and values</li>
                <li>Soccer is a tool for teaching life lessons about discipline, teamwork, and perseverance</li>
                <li>Creating a positive, supportive environment allows players to reach their full potential</li>
                <li>Coaches serve as mentors and role models, not just instructors</li>
